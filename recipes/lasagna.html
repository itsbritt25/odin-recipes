        <li>1(16 ounce) package shredded mozerella cheese</li>

     </ul>

     <h2>Steps:</h2>
     
     <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until browned.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles, stirring occasionally, under tender. Preheat oven to 375 degree F, while noodles are cooking. Drain and set aside. </li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, 1 tablespoon parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13- inch baking dish just to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover</li>
        <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozerella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozerella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5-10 more minutes.</li>
